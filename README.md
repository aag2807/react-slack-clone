# Rack-Chat

Rack-chat is a slack clone elaborated with react, semantic-ui 
& firebase.
Intended only for big screens, I'll make it responsive as time goes by.

## Usage

```React.js
Make sure to
create your own firebase config and save it in the components folder.
Then just 'npm start' and take a look in port :3000
```
