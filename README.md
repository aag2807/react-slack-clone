# Rack-Chat


Rack-chat is a slack clone elaborated with react, semantic-ui 
& firebase.
Intended only for big screens, I'll make it responsive as time goes by.

## Usage

```React.js
Make sure to
foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
